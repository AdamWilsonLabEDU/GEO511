# Structure updates

first draft submitted earilier for video feedback.


File Structure

* put all case studies in .Rmd with github markdown output (include summary of project, name, etc.)
* Use github actions to ensure content builds
* gitignore data
* Grand checklist for completed tasks?
* update links to course repository


General repository rules:
* never use an absolute path (e.g. ~/Desktop/RClass/...)
* never commit large files (100MB max, better < 5mb)
    * instructions if you did this accidentally
* push before your pull error
  ```>>> git push origin refs/heads/master
   ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.```


Package presentation?  IF keeping, use a Rmd structure inside course repositories so they can be opened on the fly.


## 2020

* Break assignments into separate repositories with tests?
