### Project Proposal

The project proposal will be about 1 page in length and include the following:
  
1.  Introduction to problem/question
2.  Links to inspiring examples:  Include links and screenshots of a few (~3-5) example graphics found on the internet that convey what you want to do.  Include a few sentences about why you selected each link.
2.  Proposed data sources: Be as specific as possible.
3.  Proposed methods: List the approach you will use. Don't simply list packages, tell me what you will do with them.
4.  Expected results: Describe what you want to produce (graphics, analyses, etc.)

Finding good data takes time, and can take longer than the time to tidy your data.  This task could easily take 3-6 hours to find the data you need for your project.  After you find good data sources make sure to complete the remaining tasks.



Use [this template (which is an R Markdown File) for your project proposal](scripts/Project_ProposalTemplate.Rmd).  You can view this file on [github here](https://github.com/AdamWilsonLab/GEO511/blob/master/Project_ProposalTemplate.Rmd) and see what this file looks like 'after rendering' [here](Project_ProposalTemplate.html).

In particular, notice the the YAML header of the .Rmd file:
```
---
title: "Project Proposal Template"
author: Ideel Stoodent
output: 
  github_document
---
```

The `output: github_document` tells knitr to create a markdown file from your R markdown file.  If you don't have any code, R Markdown is essentially the same as markdown, but github knows how to display it (making headers bold, etc.).    Then you can push the .Rmd and .md to github just like a R script as you have been doing.
