# HTML Visualization

## DataTables

[DataTables](http://rstudio.github.io/DT/) display R data frames as interactive HTML tables (with filtering, pagination, sorting, and search).  This is a great way to make your raw data viewable without using too much space.

Don't use for large datasets in your website, though!  (Any idea why?)


``` r
library(widgetframe)
library(DT)
datatable(iris, options = list(pageLength = 5)) %>% 
  frameableWidget()
```

```{=html}
<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-3890120d31668c6805f2" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>
<script>HTMLWidgets.pymChild = new pym.Child();HTMLWidgets.addPostRenderHandler(function(){
                                setTimeout(function(){HTMLWidgets.pymChild.sendHeight();},100);
                            });</script>
<script type="application/json"

```


## Leaflet

[Leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) is a really powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic maps that support panning and zooming along with various annotations like markers, polygons, and popups.  


``` r
library(leaflet)
library(ggmap)
m <- leaflet() %>% setView(lng = -78.88642, lat = 42.89606, zoom = 12) %>%   addTiles()
```

Most HTML outputs will need to be run with `frameWidget()` to appear in a rmarkdown document.  Simply wrap the output with:


``` r
frameWidget(m,height =500)
```

```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-1d821f2c442b628f515a" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1d821f2c442b628f515a">{"x":{"url":"widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-6.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```

## dygraphs
Provides rich facilities for charting time-series data in R, including highly configurable series- and axis-display and interactive features like zoom/pan and series/point highlighting.
    

``` r
library(dygraphs)
dy1=dygraph(nhtemp, main = "New Haven Temperatures",height = 75) %>% 
  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1920-01-01", "1960-01-01"))
```

```


## rthreejs

Create interactive 3D scatter plots, network plots, and globes using the ['three.js' visualization library](https://threejs.org).
    

``` r
#devtools::install_github("bwlewis/rthreejs")
library(threejs)
z <- seq(-10, 10, 0.1)
x <- cos(z)
y <- sin(z)
js3=scatterplot3js(x, y, z, color=rainbow(length(z)))
```

---


```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-97129feaa5c70d557deb" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-97129feaa5c70d557deb">{"x":{"url":"widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-10.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```

## networkD3

Creates 'D3' 'JavaScript' network, tree, dendrogram, and Sankey graphs from 'R'.
    

``` r
library(igraph)
library(networkD3)
```


## Load example network
This loads an example social network of friendships between 34 members of a karate club at a US university in the 1970s. See W. W. Zachary, An information flow model for conflict and fission in small groups, Journal of Anthropological Research 33, 452-473 (1977).


``` r
karate <- make_graph("Zachary")
wc <- cluster_walktrap(karate)
members <- membership(wc)

# Convert to object suitable for networkD3
karate_d3 <- igraph_to_networkD3(karate, group = members)

n3d=forceNetwork(Links = karate_d3$links, Nodes = karate_d3$nodes,
             Source = 'source', Target = 'target', NodeID = 'name',
             Group = 'group')
```

## Force directed network plot


```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-8b3905f669f92cd4a85f" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-8b3905f669f92cd4a85f">{"x":{"url":"widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-13.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```


## Sankey Network graph

Sankey diagrams are flow diagrams in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.


``` r
# Load energy projection data
library(jsonlite)
URL <- paste0(
        "https://cdn.rawgit.com/christophergandrud/networkD3/",
        "master/JSONdata/energy.json")
Energy <- fromJSON(URL)

sn1=sankeyNetwork(Links = Energy$links, Nodes = Energy$nodes, Source = "source",
             Target = "target", Value = "value", NodeID = "name",
             units = "TWh", fontSize = 12, nodeWidth = 30)
```

---


```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-9a3864a3851b2d8b388f" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-9a3864a3851b2d8b388f">{"x":{"url":"widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-15.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```

## Radial Network

``` r
URL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophergandrud/networkD3/master/JSONdata/flare.json"
## Convert to list format
Flare <- jsonlite::fromJSON(URL, simplifyDataFrame = FALSE)
# Use subset of data for more readable diagram
Flare$children = Flare$children[1:3]

rn1=radialNetwork(List = Flare, fontSize = 10, opacity = 0.9, height = 400, width=400)
```

---


```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-e743bac3d4ae3108cd64" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-e743bac3d4ae3108cd64">{"x":{"url":"widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-17.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```

## Diagonal Network

``` r
dn1=diagonalNetwork(List = Flare, fontSize = 10, 
                    opacity = 0.9, height = 400, width=400)

frameWidget(dn1,height =500)
```

```{=html}
<div id="htmlwidget-09d3947f919c82b022b9" style="width:100%;height:500px;" class="widgetframe html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-09d3947f919c82b022b9">{"x":{"url":"widgets/widget_unnamed-chunk-18.html","options":{"xdomain":"*","allowfullscreen":false,"lazyload":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
```

## Other D3 Visualizations
[https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)
![](PS_12/D3_examples.png)

## rglwidget

RGL provides 3D interactive graphics, including functions modelled on base graphics (`plot3d()`, etc.) as well as functions for constructing representations of geometric objects (`cube3d()`, etc.).  You may need to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/).


``` r
library(rgl)
```

```
## Warning in rgl.init(initValue, onlyNULL): RGL: unable to open X11 display
```

```
## Warning: 'rgl.init' failed, running with 'rgl.useNULL = TRUE'.
```

``` r
library(htmltools)

theta <- seq(0, 6*pi, len=100)
xyz <- cbind(sin(theta), cos(theta), theta)
lineid <- plot3d(xyz, type="l", alpha = 1:0, 
                 lwd = 5, col = "blue")["data"]
```

## Animate an interactive 3D process

``` r
rg1=browsable(tagList(
  rglwidget(elementId = "example", width = 800, height = 600,
            controllers = "player"),
  playwidget("example", 
             ageControl(births = theta, ages = c(0, 0, 1),
                        objids = lineid, alpha = c(0, 1, 0)),
                        start = 1, stop = 6*pi, step = 0.1, 
                        rate = 6,elementId = "player")
))%>%save_html(file="rgl.html")
```
