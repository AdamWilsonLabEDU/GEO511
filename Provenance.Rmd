## Course Provenance

This course was developed by integrating ideas across other courses and resources.  I am indebted to others who share their course materials online with open-source license allowing the open sharing of ideas and best practices.  In particular, I would like to recognize:

* [MATH/CS 335 - Data Wrangling and Visualization](https://byuistats.github.io/M335/index.html): A course by  J. Hathaway at Brigham Young University. I adapted the course structure, grading style, learning objectives from this innovative open-source course.
