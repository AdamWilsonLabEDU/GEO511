title: "Case Studies"
subtitle: "Set yourself up to follow along efficiently"

During our first class after the prior week's case study was completed we will spend the first 15-30 minutes in a team meeting.  Here are the guidelines.

### Groups

* **Lead:** Those that are prepared to lead the team discussion with their completed case study should sign up on [UBLearns](https://ublearns.buffalo.edu)

* **Support:** Others will write their names next to the leader and sit near the lead.  A minimum of least three members on each team is required.

* **Diversity:** Your groups cannot be identical from week to week.

### Discussion

1. The team lead will present their work to the team for a discussion on how it addresses the case study. 
2. During the presentation the team discusses additional questions that could help in furthering the analysis. These questions need to be typed under the team lead's task in GitHub.
2. Team members discuss if the graphical analysis provides answers to the driving question.
3. Team members make a plan to critique each others work.  If all have completed the task you could possibly do the critiques during this time.

## Leadership Principles

The real world concept that we are connecting to is that there are times when we can show up to a meeting not as prepared.  However, we better have more moments than not where we are contributing to the meeting or we will quickly become unnecessary. 

* Complete the class task before class starts to participate in conversation
* Be a class lead during class (see syllabus for details)
