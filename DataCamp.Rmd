DataCamp offers interactive R, Python, Sheets, SQL and shell courses on topics in data science, statistics and machine learning. You can learn from a team of expert teachers in the comfort of your browser with video lessons and fun coding challenges and projects.

## DataCamp in this course

As a student in this course, you will receive a six month subscription to DataCamp's 'premium' materials.  We will use DataCamp to reinforce your learning _and_ assess your development. Throughout the semester, various chapters/courses will be assigned via DataCamp.  I have assigned due dates to each DataCamp assignment that are aligned with course content and case studies.  It is _highly recommened to complete the assigned chapters by the due dates_ designated in your [DataCamp 'classroom'](`r datacampurl`), but in terms of your grade the only deadline is the end of the semester.

See [Syllabus for more information.](Syllabus.html)  


## Additional recommended DataCamp courses

The courses listed below are optional (if not assigned in your [classroom](`r datacampurl`)) but you may find them useful to further your own development (or even to work on your final project in this or other courses).
