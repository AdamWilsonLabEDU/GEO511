# Background
The raster data format is commonly used for environmental datasets such as elevation, climate, soil, and land cover. We commonly need to `extract` the data from raster objects using simple features (vector objects).  For example if you had a set of points you collected using a GPS and wanted to know the mean annual temperature at each point, you might `extract` the data from each location in a raster-based map of temperature.

You could also be interested in some summary of the raster data across multiple pixels (such as the buffered points above, a transect, or within a polygon).  For example, you might be interested in the mean elevation within the entire polygon in the above figure.

In this case study we'll work with a [HadCRUT temperature data](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/) from the [Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/climatic-research-unit).  These are near-global rasters of surface temperature on a five degree grid.    

# Objective
> Identify the hottest country on each continent by intersecting a set of polygons with a raster image and calculating the maximum raster value in each polygon.

The details below describe one possible approach.

## Libraries
You will need to load the following packages
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(terra)
library(spData)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

Loading the `spData()` package may return a warning: `To access larger datasets...install spDataLarge...`.  This is not required - you can use the standard lower resolution files and safely ignore this message.

## Data
Download the mean annual temperatures over the reference period 1961-1990 [Climatic Research Unit data (CRU) here](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/).  Absolute temperatures for the base period 1961-90 on a 5° by 5° grid. Download these data in netcdf format using the code below: 
```{r}
library(ncdf4)
download.file("https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/absolute.nc","crudata.nc")

# read in the data using the rast() function from the terra package
tmean=rast("crudata.nc")
```
Note:  If the above code returns an error about `nc_open()`, try adding `method="curl"` at the end of the `download.file()` command.

## Steps
1. Prepare Climate Data 
    1. Download and load the CRU data using the code above (`tmean=rast("crudata.nc")`).
    2. Inspect the new `tmean` object (you can start by just typing it's name `tmean`, then perhaps making a `plot()`).  How many layers does it have?  What do these represent?  You can read more about the data [here](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/)
    3. The CRU data are stored as degrees C.  
2. Calculate the maximum temperature observed in each country.
    1. use `max()` to calculate the maximum value observed in each pixel across all months.  You may want to `plot()` the output of this and compare the plot of the original (full) raster. How many layers does it have now?
    2. use `terra::extract()` to identify the maximum temperature observed in each country (`fun=max`). Also set `na.rm=T, small=T` to 1) handle missing data along coastlines and 2) account for small countries that may not have a pixel centroid in them.
    2. use `bind_cols()` to bind the original `world` dataset with the new summary of the temperature data to create a new object called `world_clim` with the outputs from the `extract()` function above. 
3. Communicate your results
    1. use `ggplot()` and `geom_sf()` to plot the maximum temperature in each country polygon (not the original raster layer).  To recreate the image below, you will also need `+scale_fill_viridis_c(name="Maximum\nTemperature (C)")`.  Note the use of `\n` to insert a line break in the text string. You can move the legend around with `+theme(legend.position = 'bottom')`.
    2. use `dplyr` tools to find the hottest country in each continent. You may need `group_by()` and `slice_max`.  To create a nice looking table, you may also want to use `select()` to keep only the desired columns, `arrange()` to sort them, `st_set_geometry(NULL)` to drop the geometry column (if desired).  Save this table as `hottest_continents`.
</div>
</div>

Your final result should look something like this:

```{r purl=F, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
max_temp <- tmean %>%
  max() %>%
  terra::extract(y=world, fun=max, na.rm=T, small=T)

world_clim=bind_cols(world,max_temp)

ggplot(world_clim,aes(fill=max))+
  geom_sf()+
  coord_sf(label_graticule="SW",label_axes="SW")+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name="Maximum\nTemperature (C)")+
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```

And the summary table will look like this:
```{r purl=F, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
hottest_continents <- world_clim%>%
  group_by(continent)%>%
  slice_max(n=1,order_by=max)%>%
  dplyr::select(name_long,continent,max)%>%
  arrange(desc(max))%>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)

hottest_continents %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Note that these data are based on 0.5 degree resolution data and thus will miss small hot places and cannot be directly compared with station-based data.

Build a [leaflet map](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) of the same dataset.

```{r, purl=F, echo=F}
library(leaflet)
library(htmlwidgets)

pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "YlOrRd",
  domain = world_clim$max,
  reverse = F
)

l=world_clim%>%
  leaflet() %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(stroke = FALSE, smoothFactor = 0.2, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    color = pal(world_clim$max),
                    popup = paste("Maximum Monthly Temperature = ", round(world_clim$max, 2)," C"))%>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~max,
    title = "Maximum Temperature (C)",
    labFormat = labelFormat(suffix = "C"),
    opacity = 1
  )

f <-"CS06_leaflet.html"
saveWidget(l,file.path(normalizePath(dirname(f)),basename(f)),libdir="externals",selfcontained = T)
```
