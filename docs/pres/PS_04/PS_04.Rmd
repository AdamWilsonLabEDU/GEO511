# Relational Data

## Relational Data

Flight Table in `library(nycflights13)`
```{r, echo=F, message=F}
library(nycflights13)
library(kableExtra)

flights%>% slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format= "html")%>%
  kable_styling(font_size=10) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "200px")
```
<br><br>
Airport table in `library(nycflights13)`
```{r, echo=F, message=F}
airports %>% slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable(format= "html")%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "condensed",font_size=10) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "200px")
```

## Visualizing Relational Data

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-setup.png)

* **Primary key**: uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, `planes$tailnum` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each plane in the planes table.
* **Foreign key**: uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, the `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key because it appears in the flights table where it matches each flight to a unique plane.

## 3 families of verbs designed to work with relational data

* **Mutating joins**: add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another
* **Filtering joins**: filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.
* **Set operations**: treat observations as if they were set elements



## Inner Join
![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-inner.png)

Matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal:

## Outer Joins

* `left_join` keeps all observations in x
* `right_join` keeps all observations in y
* `full_join` keeps all observations in x and y

# Potential Problems

## Duplicate Keys
### One table w/ duplicates
![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png)

## Duplicate Keys
### Both tables w/ duplicates
![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-many-to-many.png)

## Missing Keys
### `semi_join(x, y)` keeps all observations in x that have a match in y.

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-semi.png)

## `anti_join(x, y)` drops all observations in x that have a match in y.

Anti-joins are useful for diagnosing join mismatches.

# Compare with other functions

## `merge()`

`base::merge()` can perform all four types of joins:

dplyr              | merge
-------------------|-------------------------------------------
`inner_join(x, y)` | `merge(x, y)`
`left_join(x, y)`  | `merge(x, y, all.x = TRUE)`
`right_join(x, y)` | `merge(x, y, all.y = TRUE)`
`full_join(x, y)`  | `merge(x, y, all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)`

* specific dplyr verbs more clearly convey the intent of your code: they are concealed in the arguments of <span class="bullet_code">merge()</span>.
* dplyr's joins are considerably faster and don't mess with the order of the rows.

## SQL

SQL is the inspiration for dplyr's conventions, so the translation is straightforward:

dplyr                        | SQL
-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------
`inner_join(x, y, by = "z")` | `SELECT * FROM x INNER JOIN y USING (z)`
`left_join(x, y, by = "z")`  | `SELECT * FROM x LEFT OUTER JOIN y USING (z)`
`right_join(x, y, by = "z")` | `SELECT * FROM x RIGHT OUTER JOIN y USING (z)`
`full_join(x, y, by = "z")`  | `SELECT * FROM x FULL OUTER JOIN y USING (z)`


* Note that "INNER" and "OUTER" are optional, and often omitted.
* SQL supports a wider  range of join types than dplyr

## Set Operations

* `intersect(x, y)`: return only observations in both x and y.
* `union(x, y)`: return unique observations in x and y.
* `setdiff(x, y)`: return observations in x, but not in y.
