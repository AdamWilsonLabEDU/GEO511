## What is a Spatial Feature (sf)?

Typically an object in the real world, such as a building or a tree. 

Features could include:

* a forest (polygon)
* a tree in the forest (point or polygon)
* a branch on the tree (line?)
* a complete image (multipoint, polygon, raster)
* a satellite image pixel of that forest (point or polgyon or raster)

## Spatial Features

What information do we need to store in order to define points, lines, polygons in geographic space?

 - lat/lon coordinates
 - projection
 - what type (point/line/poly)
 - if polygon, is it a hole or not
 - attribute data
 - ... ?

---

## Geometry

Features have a _geometry_ describing _where_ on Earth the
feature is located, and they have attributes, which describe other
properties. 

A Tree: 

* delineation of its crown
* its stem
* point indicating its centre

Attributes:

* species 
* height
* diameter
* date of observation
* ...

## Spatial Feature Standard

"_A simple feature is defined by the OpenGIS Abstract specification to have both spatial and non-spatial attributes. Spatial attributes are geometry valued, and simple features are based on 2D geometry with linear interpolation between vertices._"  

## Dimensions

All geometries composed of points: coordinates in 2-, 3- or 4-dimensional space.  

* **X** coordinate in X direction (typically longitude or similar)
* **Y** coordinate in Y direction (typically latitude or similar)
* **Z** coordinate denoting altitude
* **M** coordinate (rarely used), denoting some _measure_ that is associated with the point, rather than with the feature as a whole (in which case it would be a feature attribute); examples could be time of measurement, or measurement error.

## Dimensions

The four possible cases then are:

1. 2D (XY): x and y, easting and northing, or longitude and latitude
2. 3D (XYZ): three-dimensional points
3. 3D (XYM): three-dimensional points where 3rd is some attribute space
4. 4D (XYZM): four-dimensional points as XYZM (the third axis is Z, fourth M)

## Common Simple Feature (SF) types

![](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/figures/sf-classes.png)

## Seven common Simple Feature (SF) geometry types

| type | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `POINT` | a single point |
| `LINESTRING` | sequence of points connected by lines |
| `POLYGON` | sequence of points form a closed ring |
| `MULTIPOINT` | set of points |
| `MULTILINESTRING` | set of linestrings |
| `MULTIPOLYGON` | set of polygons |
| `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` | set of geometries |

Some formats only include these (e.g. [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946))


## Uncommon Geometry Types 
10 more geometries 10 are rare:

* `CIRCULARSTRING`
* `COMPOUNDCURVE` 
* `CURVEPOLYGON` 
* `MULTICURVE` 
* `MULTISURFACE` 
* `CURVE` 
* `SURFACE` 
* `POLYHEDRALSURFACE` 
* `TIN` 
* `TRIANGLE`

---
## Coordinate reference system

SFs can only be placed on the Earth's surface when their coordinate
reference system (CRS) is known; this may be an elipsoidal CRS such as WGS84, a projected, two-dimensional (Cartesian) CRS such as a UTM zone or Web Mercator, or a CRS
in three-dimensions or [including time](http://www.faculty.jacobs-university.de/pbaumann/iu-bremen.de_pbaumann/Papers/acmgis-2012_crs-nts.pdf). Similarly, M-coordinates need an attribute reference
system, e.g. a [measurement unit](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=units).


---

There are currently two main approaches in R to handle geographic vector data. 

---

## `sp` package

First package for spatial data: [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp). Provides classes and methods to create _points_, _lines_, _polygons_, and _grids_ and to operate on them. 

~350 of the spatial analysis packages use `sp` data types, so it is important to know how to convert **sp** to and from **sf** objects.


## `sf` package

[`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) implements a formal standard called ["Simple Features"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) that specifies a storage and access model of spatial geometries (point, line, polygon). 

A feature geometry is called simple when it consists of points connected by straight line pieces, and does not intersect itself. 

This standard has been adopted widely, not only by spatial databases such as PostGIS, but also more recent standards such as GeoJSON. 

## How simple features in R are organized

All spatial functions and methods in `sf` prefixed by `st_` (refering to _spatial and temporal_)

Simple features are implemented as R native data, using simple data structures (S3 classes, lists,
matrix, vector).  

---

Stored as `data.frame` objects (or very similar `tbl_df`) with _feature geometries in
a `data.frame` column_. 

Since geometries are not single-valued,
they are put in a list-column, a list of length equal to the number
of records in the `data.frame`, with each list element holding the simple
feature geometry of that feature.  

## Components

* `sf`, the table (`data.frame`) with feature attributes and feature geometries, which contains
* `sfc`, the list-column with the geometries for each feature (record), which is composed of
* `sfg`, the feature geometry of an individual simple feature.

---

If you work with PostGis or GeoJSON you may have come across the [WKT (well-known text)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) format, for example like these: 

    POINT (30 10)
    LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40)
    POLYGON ((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))

`sf` implements this standard natively in R. Data are structured and conceptualized very differently from the `sp` approach.

---

## I. Create geometric objects (topology)  

Geometric objects (simple features) can be created from a numeric vector, matrix or a list with the coordinates. They are called `sfg` objects for Simple Feature Geometry.

Create a LINESTRING `sfg` object:
```{r}
xy=matrix(runif(6), ncol=2)
xy
lnstr_sfg <- st_linestring(xy) 
class(lnstr_sfg)
lnstr_sfg
```

---

## II. Combine all individual single feature objects for the special column. 

Create a `sfc` (Simple Feature Collection) object of individual features:
```{r}
lnstr_sfc <- st_sfc(lnstr_sfg) # just one feature here
class(lnstr_sfc)
lnstr_sfc
```
The `sfc` object also holds the bounding box and the projection information.


## III. Add attributes. 

Add attributes (in a `data.frame`) to the `sfc` object to make a `sf` (Simple Features) object:

```{r}
dfr=data.frame(type="random")
lnstr_sf <- st_sf(dfr , lnstr_sfc)
class(lnstr_sf)
lnstr_sf
```

---
```{r, echo=F}
knitr::kable(lnstr_sf)
```

---

## sf Highlights

* provides **fast** I/O, particularly relevant for large files 
* directly reads from and writes to spatial **databases** such as PostGIS
* compatibile with the *tidyverse*
* recent `ggplot` release can read and plot the `sf` format without conversion

---

`sp` and `sf` are _not_ only formats for spatial objects. Other spatial packages may use their own class definitions for spatial data (for example `spatstat`). Usually you can find functions that convert `sp` and increasingly `sf` objects to and from these formats.

## Converting formats 

```{r}
data(world) #load 'world' data from spData package
world_sp = as(world, "Spatial") # convert from sf to sp
world_sf = st_as_sf(world_sp) #convert from sp to sf
str(world_sp)
```

---

```{r}
str(world)
```

---



- The structures in the **sp** packages are more complicated - `str(world_sf)` vs `str(world_sp)`
  
- Moreover, many of the **sp** functions are not "pipeable" (it's hard to combine them with the **tidyverse**)

```{r, eval = F}
world_sp %>% 
  filter(name_long == "Papua New Guinea")
```
`Error in UseMethod("filter_") : no applicable method for 'filter_' `
`applied to an object of class "c('SpatialPolygonsDataFrame', 'SpatialPolygons',`
`'Spatial', 'SpatialPolygonsNULL', 'SpatialVector')"`

```{r}
world %>% 
  filter(name_long == "Papua New Guinea")
```


---

## Reading and writing spatial data

```{r}
vector_filepath = system.file("shapes/world.gpkg", package = "spData")
vector_filepath
world = st_read(vector_filepath)
```

Counterpart to `st_read()` is the `st_write` function, e.g. `st_write(world, 'data/new_world.gpkg')`. A full list of supported formats could be found using `sf::st_drivers()`.

---

## Structure of the sf objects 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
world
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
print(world, n=3)
```

```{r}
class(world)
```

---

## Structure of the sf objects 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world$name_long
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
world$name_long[1:3]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
world$geom
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world$geom, n = 3)
```


## Non-spatial operations on sf objects

> Which countries have the highest population density?

```{r}
print(world, n=3)
print(worldbank_df, n=3)
```

---

```{r, warning=FALSE}
pop_den <-
  world %>% 
  left_join(worldbank_df, by = "iso_a2") %>%
  mutate(pop_density = pop/area_km2) %>%
  dplyr::select(name_long, pop_density) %>%
  arrange(desc(pop_density))
```

```{r echo=F}
pop_den%>%
  slice(1:5)%>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL)%>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(pop_den)+
  geom_sf(aes(fill=pop_density,geometry=geom))+
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```


## Non-spatial operations

```{r}
world_cont = world %>% 
        group_by(continent) %>% 
        summarize(pop_sum = sum(pop, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  arrange(desc(pop_sum))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
print(world_cont, n = 3)
```

---

The `st_set_geometry` function can be used to remove the geometry column:

```{r}
world_df =st_set_geometry(world_cont, NULL)
class(world_df)
```

---

## Spatial operations

It's a big topic which includes:

- Spatial subsetting
- Spatial joining/aggregation
- Topological relations
- Distances
- Spatial geometry modification
- Raster operations (map algebra)

See [Chapter 4](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/spatial-data-operations.html#spatial-operations-on-raster-data) of *Geocomputation with R* 

## CRS

Transform (warp) to a different projection:
```{r}
na_2163 = world %>%
  filter(continent == "North America") %>% 
  st_transform(2163) #US National Atlas Equal Area
st_crs(na_2163)
```

---

## Compare projections

```{r, message=F}
library(gridExtra)  # for combining ggplots
na = world %>% filter(continent == "North America")
p1=na_2163 %>% ggplot()+geom_sf(aes(geometry=geom))
p2=na %>% ggplot()+geom_sf(aes(geometry=geom))
grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

For more on `grid.arrange`, see [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html).

---

## Spatial operations

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
canada = na_2163 %>% 
  filter(name_long=="Canada")

canada_buffer=canada%>%
  st_buffer(500000)

ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data=canada,aes(geometry=geom))+
  geom_sf(data=canada_buffer,col="red",fill=NA)
```

# Visualization


## Basic maps

- Basic maps of `sf` objects can be quickly created using the `plot()` function:

```{r}
plot(world[0])
```
---

```{r}
plot(world["pop"])
```

## ggplot and geom_sf()

```{r}
ggplot(world)+
  geom_sf(aes(geometry=geom,fill=lifeExp))+
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

All the nice ggplot features are available

## leaflet: javascript library for interactive maps
```{r, message=F}
library(leaflet)
library(widgetframe)
```
 [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)  leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 38 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.


## Construct the leaflet map

```{r}
l=leaflet(world) %>%
        addTiles() %>%
        addPolygons(color = "#444444", weight = 1, fillOpacity = 0.5,
                    fillColor = ~colorQuantile("YlOrRd", lifeExp)(lifeExp),
                    popup = paste("Life Expectancy =", round(world$lifeExp, 2)))
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=F,message=F}
f <-"presentations/world_leaflet.html"
saveWidget(l,file.path(normalizePath(dirname(f)),basename(f)),
           libdir="externals",
           selfcontained = T)
```

## Raster data in the tidyverse

Raster data is not yet closely connected to the **tidyverse**, however:

- Some functions from `raster` work well in `pipes`
- Convert vector data to `Spatial*` form using `as(my_vector, "Spatial")` for raster-vector interactions
- Some early efforts to bring raster data into the **tidyverse**, including [tabularaster](https://github.com/hypertidy/tabularaster), [sfraster](https://github.com/mdsumner/sfraster), [fasterize](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/fasterize), and [stars](https://github.com/r-spatial/stars) (multidimensional, large datasets).
