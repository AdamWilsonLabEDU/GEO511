# Case Study Presentations

## Case Study Motivations

1. Best way to learn something is to (prepare to) teach it
2. Develop confidence presenting your method/solution/approach
3. Learn tools for transparent collaboration

## Do's and Don'ts

1. Don't be scared - this is a supportive environment.
2. Do share stories about _how_ you figured it out:
   * other things you tried
   * things that didn't work
3. Do mention your group mates and any contributions they made (if they did)

```{r child = "resource_case_study.Rmd"}
```


## Writing Code

You are doing two things at the same time:

1. accomplishing some task _now_
2. collaborating with your future self (or someone else) 

SO:

1. Include lots of comments to understand and repeat what you did
2. Remember to clean up your code when you've finished!
3. Consider the style guide...
