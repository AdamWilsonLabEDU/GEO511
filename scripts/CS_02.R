#' # Background
#' 
#' You are at a family gathering at Niagara Falls and your grandfather claims that summer temperatures are hotter now than they were when he was a kid in the 1920s.  His brother disagrees - he remembers summers being just as hot as they are now.   Your inner data scientist thinks this is an empirical question that you can answer with data.
#' 
#' You will use the NASA GISS temperature record for the Buffalo Niagara Airport available [from this website](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/stdata_show_v4.cgi?id=USW00014733&ds=14&dt=1).  Later we'll learn how to use APIs to interact with online databases, but for now we'll work with a simple csv file.
#' 
#' # Instructions
#' 
#' ## Download the temperature data
#' 
#' If you explore the [NASA GISS website](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/) for a station ([Buffalo, NY website](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/stdata_show_v4.cgi?id=USW00014733&ds=14&dt=1)), you'll find they provide a link to download the data directly as a comma-separated-values (CSV) file.  CSV files are simple text files with commas in between the values.  They are a common format for storing and sharing relatively small tabular datasets because they are so simple that many different software can open them, from Excel to ArcGIS.
#' 
## ---- message=F---------------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)

# define the link to the data - you can try this in your browser too.  Note that the URL ends in .txt.
dataurl="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/tmp/gistemp/STATIONS/tmp_USW00014733_14_0_1/station.txt"

#' 
#' 
#' This url points to a CSV file with monthly mean temperatures from the GISS dataset.  You can [check out the file here](`r dataurl`).  Now use `read_table()` to download and import the table directly from the website (cool, huh!?).
#' 
## ---- message=F, eval=T-------------------------------------------------------
#the next line tells the NASA site to create the temporary file
httr::GET("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/stdata_show_v4.cgi?id=USW00014733&ds=14&dt=1")
# the next lines download the data
temp=read_table(dataurl,
              skip=3, #skip the first line which has column names
              na="999.90", # tell R that 999.90 means missing in this dataset
              col_names = c("YEAR","JAN","FEB","MAR", # define column names 
                            "APR","MAY","JUN","JUL",  
                            "AUG","SEP","OCT","NOV",  
                            "DEC","DJF","MAM","JJA",  
                            "SON","metANN"))
# renaming is necessary becuase they used dashes ("-")
# in the column names and R doesn't like that.

#' 
#' If the command above gives you an error, open [the page](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/gistemp/stdata_show_v4.cgi?id=USW00014733&ds=14&dt=1) in the browser and update the `dataurl` link to download the csv. 
#' 
#' ## Explore the data
#' 
#' Now use your tools to explore the dataset.  You can try `View(temp)` to open the table in a browsable 'excel-like' window.  Or `summary(temp)` to get summaries of each column. Or `glimpse(temp)`.
#' 
#' ## Develop the graphic
#' 
#' You want to make a nice graphic to show your grandfather at your next family gathering.  Be sure to include informative axis labels, a graph title, a graph subtitle describing the source of the data, the raw data, and a smoothed line showing the overall trend through time.  
#' 
#' It should look something like this:
#' 

#' 
## ---- eval=F,echo=F-----------------------------------------------------------
## png("CS_02_img/buffalo.png")
## p1
## dev.off()

#' 
#' What do you tell your grandfather and his brother?  What additional tests / visualizations could you do?
#' 
#' # Extra time?
#' 
#' If you have extra time, use the [station selector](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data_v4_globe/) to find the links to download additional stations and make additional plots.  You could even merge different stations into the same table and plot them together.  
#' 
#' Can you think of other plots to consider?  Perhaps aggregating to mean temperature by decade?
