#' ## Your problem
#' 
#' You want to make a figure illustrating the distribution of GDP per capita for all countries within each continent using the `world` data in the `spData` package.  
#' 
#' ### Your goal
#' Your desired figure looks something like the following:

#' 
#' ### Current Version of your code
#' You have started working on the figure but can't seem to make it work like you want.  Here is your current version of the code (and the resulting figure):
#' 
## ---- warning=F, fig.width=15-------------------------------------------------
ggplot(world,aes(x=gdpPercap, y=continent, color=continent))+
   geom_density(alpha=0.5,color=F)

#' 
#' The second figure is quite different from the one you want.  You want to ask for help and so you know that you need to make a reproducible example.  Starting with the code above, make the required edits so you can use `reprex()` to generate a nicely formatted example that you could email or post to a forum to ask for help.  See the [reading](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) for more help. Note: you do _not_ need to recreate the first figure above, only to use `reprex()` to illustrate your question and problematic code.
#' 
#' <div class="well">
#' <button data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm round" data-target="#demo1">Show Hints</button>
#' <div id="demo1" class="collapse">
#' 
#' ## Steps
#' 1. Download the [<i class="fa fa-file-code-o fa-1x" aria-hidden="true"></i> starter R script (if desired)](`r output_nocomment`){target="_blank"}.  Save this directly to your course folder (repository) so you don't lose track of it!
#' 2. Add code (only 3 lines) needed to produce the second plot (load the required libraries above and load the `world` data)
#' 2. Copy the code to your clipboard
#' 3. run `reprex()` to generate the reproducible example in the "Viewer Pane"
#' 4. Export the preview as an html file and save it in your course repository.  It should look something like this:
#' ![](assets/reprex.png)
#' 
#' </div>
#' </div>
#' 
#' 
#' <div class="extraswell">
#' <button data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-link" data-target="#extras">
#' Extra time? Try this...
#' </button>
#' <div id="extras" class="collapse">
#' Fix the code above to recreate the first figure.
#' </div>
#' </div>
