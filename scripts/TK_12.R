#' # Project Peer Evaluation
#' 
#' Plan to spend at least 1 hour for each review (2 hours total). The objectives for this assignment are to:
#' 
#' 1. See what other students are doing for their final project
#' 2. Understand how to organize code and data to make it easily reproducible (by others or your future self)
#' 4. Learn how to provide feedback through the 'pull request' mechanism in GitHub.
#' 3. Provide feedback to help improve other student's projects
#' 
#' ## Instructions
#' 
#' ### Selecting a project to evaluate
#' 
#' 1. Browse the [current drafts of projects here](https://github.com/geo511-2020?q=project&type=&language=).  
#' 2. Select two repositories and evaluate them according to the instructions listed in the [Project First Draft task](TK_11.html)

#' 
#' ### Download and reproduce the project
#' 
#' 1) Explore the final projects in the [class repository](https://github.com/geo511-2020?q=project&type=&language=)
#' 2) Select two projects that do not already have two evaluations (pull requests). For example, in the image above, there are 0 pull requests, so this repository would be available for you to review.  If there are already 2 pull requests, select another repository.
#' 2) Go to the github page linked in the assignment and download the repository as a zip file (click on the <img src='project_assets/download.png' width=100> button).
#' 3) Unzip the file after it downloads
#' 4) Open the project or `index.Rmd` in RStudio and click `Build Website` in the `Build` tab in the upper right.
#' 5) Evaluate whether the project meets the specifications listed in the [Project First Draft task](TK_11.html)
#' 
#' 
#' ### Provide feedback and evaluation via pull request
#' 
#' After you reproduce the project, you will provide feedback via pull request.
#' 
#' The following video will walk you through the steps of providing feedback via a pull request.

#' 
#' 1) In the "Code" tab of the github page for the project, click on the file you want to provide feedback on (typically this will be `index.Rmd`)
#' 2) Click the pencil icon on the right side to edit the file
#' 3) You can make changes or comment on the code
#'    * To make changes, simply edit the text
#'    * To comment, you must still make some sort of change on the lines where you want to cmment.  The easiest thing is simply to add a space at the end of the line (as I do in the video above).
#' 4) At the bottom of the file, there is a section called "Commit Changes", select the button for **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.** and name the new branch `project_feedback_githubusername`
#' 5) Click "Propose File change"
#' 6) Click on the button "Files Changed #1" near the middle of the next page
#' 7) Hover over lines you would like to comment on and click the little blue plus button.  Then enter your comment and select "Add single comment"
#' 6) Repeat steps 2-6 for any additional files you want to comment on 
#' 
#' Be sure to install any required libraries (do not complain if it fails because you don't have a library installed).
